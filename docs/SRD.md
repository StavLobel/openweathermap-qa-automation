# System Requirements Document (SRD)

## 1. Project Overview
This project is a professional-grade QA Automation framework designed to showcase advanced testing skills using Python, Pytest, and Playwright. It supports UI, API, E2E, and non-functional testing. Reporting is handled via Allure, and CI/CD integration with GitHub Actions ensures full automation. Allure reports are deployed to GitHub Pages.

## 2. Objectives
- âœ… Demonstrate expertise in modern QA automation tools and practices.
- âœ… Build a modular, maintainable, and scalable test framework.
- âœ… Implement multi-layer testing (UI, API, E2E, Non-functional).
- âœ… Provide visual test reports and enable full CI/CD pipelines.

## 3. Functional Requirements
- âœ… UI tests automated with Playwright.
- âœ… API tests written using Playwright's APIRequestContext.
- âœ… E2E user journey validations across major browsers.
- âœ… CLI-driven execution: control environment, browser, and test tags.
- âœ… Configurable retries, timeouts, and video tracing.

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements
- âœ… Include basic performance and accessibility tests.
- âœ… Ensure reliability: tests should pass >95% consistently.
- âœ… Follow clean code practices (black, flake8, mypy).
- âœ… Add test coverage metrics and visual reports.

## 5. Tech Stack
- **Language**: Python 3.11+
- **Test Framework**: Pytest
- **Automation Tool**: Playwright (Python)
