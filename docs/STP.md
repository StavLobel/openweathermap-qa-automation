# Software Test Plan (STP)

## 1. Test Objectives
- âœ… Verify UI, API, and end-to-end flows of OpenWeatherMap application.
- âœ… Ensure correctness, stability, and performance of all layers.
- âœ… Automate CI execution and reporting.
- âœ… Simulate real-world use cases across multiple scenarios.

## 2. Scope

### In-Scope
- âœ… UI tests using Playwright for real browser simulation.
- âœ… API testing with Playwright's APIRequestContext module.
- âœ… E2E testing covering full workflows.
- âœ… Non-functional validations: basic performance + accessibility.

### Out-of-Scope
- Load/stress testing beyond functional validation.
- Native mobile testing.

## 3. Assumptions
- âœ… API endpoints are accessible and under a free usage quota.
- âœ… GitHub runners are used for CI/CD.
- âœ… Secrets (e.g. API keys) are securely managed via GitHub Secrets.

## 4. Test Strategy
- âœ… Structured test modules for each layer.
- âœ… Use of Pytest fixtures, markers, and parameterization.
- âœ… Automatic Allure reporting and GitHub Actions workflows.
- âœ… Retry failed flaky tests and capture videos/screenshots.

## 7. CI/CD Plan
- âœ… All tests run on every push/PR to `main`.
- âœ… Test artifacts uploaded and reports deployed.
- âœ… Linting + formatting checks (black, flake8, mypy).
- âœ… Fail builds on test errors, low coverage, or format violations.

pytest --browser firefox

# Run in headed mode
pytest --headed
```

### **CI/CD Execution**

## 12. Risk Mitigation

### **High Risk**: API Rate Limiting
- **Mitigation**: Implement request caching and rate limiting
